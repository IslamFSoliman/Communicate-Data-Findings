# Communicate-Data-Findings

## The "Why"
### Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process.

Exploratory data visualization usually occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that we use to understand the patterns and relationships presented in our data. This understanding will help us approach any statistical analysis and will help us build conclusions and findings.
<br>This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed.

Explanatory data visualization techniques are used after generating our findings, and are used to help communicate our results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that our message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project would also help us to be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to us by others.

## Project Findings
This project is a *win - win situation* where the company and a large number of people can benefit from this program:

- **Subscribers** `61.3%` (i.e. daily commuters) benefit from a healthy commuting choice.
- **Customers** `38.7%` (i.e. tourists, students, etc.) have a sustainable, yet flexible option for touring the city.
- The use of the service peaks mainly at `08:00AM` and `05:00PM`. This is due to work and school times in the United States.
- **Weekdays** shows *`more demand`* for the service, while **weekends** witness the *`lowest utilisation`* of service.
- The majority of **trip duration** falls between *`20 minutes or less`*.
- The busiest day of week is **Monday**.
- The **average** subscriber **trip duration** is about *`10 minutes`* and it seems to be fixed within that range without major fluctuations.
- The **variation** for *`customers`* tends to be more that that of *`subscribers`*.
